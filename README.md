# Infinitude

### Documentation and [information on protocol(s) available on the Wiki](https://github.com/nebulous/infinitude/wiki). Please contribute!

#### Infinitude is an alternative web service for [Carrier Infinity Touch](https://github.com/nebulous/infinitude/wiki/Infinity-touch) and compatible thermostats.

It allows direct web-based control of
  * Temperature setpoints
  * Schedules
  * Dealer information

As well as providing an open RESTish api and monitoring of weather and any other sensors you may want to integrate.

Infinitude can also optionally monitor the Carrier/Bryant RS485(ABCD) bus for higher resolution access to your thermostat, air handler, heat pump, and other devices. The serial monitor keeps track of the current state, and highlights changing bytes to aid in protocol analysis. Infinitude does **not** control thermostats via the RS485 bus at this time. RS485 communication is optional, and _read only_. Limited control of _non-touch_ thermostats is provided by the [Infinitive project](https://github.com/acd/infinitive)

#### Requirements

##### Software
 * Some flavor of UNIX. Both Linux and OSX are known to work.
 * Perl with the following modules
   * Mojolicious
   * DateTime
   * [IO::Termios](https://metacpan.org/module/IO::Termios) optional for RS485 serial monitoring
   * Path::Tiny
   * Try::Tiny
   * JSON
   
##### Installation
  * a cpanfile is provided which lists Infinitude's minimum dependencies.
  * use your distribution's packaging system, your favorite cpan installer, or `sudo cpanm --installdeps .` to install

###### Raspbian-specific
Many users opt to run Infinitude on a Raspberry Pi.
[More specific installation instructions are available on the wiki](https://github.com/nebulous/infinitude/wiki/Installing-Infinitude-on-Raspberry-PI-(raspbian))
 
##### Hardware
 * Basic hardware capable of running Linux. This could be a desktop machine, many people use a [Raspberry Pi](https://amzn.to/2StGo8z), or any embedded device with sufficient memory and storage. The author runs Infinitude in a Docker container on an [Atomic PI](https://amzn.to/3bgufMV), but has run it on such limited hardware as a [Pogoplug v4](http://www.amazon.com/Pogoplug-Series-4-Backup-Device/dp/B006I5MKZY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&tag=sbhq-20&qid=1415825203&sr=8-1&keywords=pogoplug) which at the time cost less than $10 USD and sits on top of the air handler like so:

#### Docker
A docker container build is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nebulous/infinitude) or you can build one manually with the included Dockerfile

Infinitude configuration parameters can be passed through environment variables into the container.  Support is included for:

| Variable | 
| --- | 
| APP_SECRET | 
| PASS_REQS | 
| MODE | 
| SERIAL_TTY |
| SERIAL_SOCKET |


the corresponding container can be run as
```
docker run \
-e APP_SECRET='YOUR_SECRET_HERE' \
-e PASS_REQS='1020' \
-e MODE='Production' \
-p 3000:3000 \
--name infinitude docker_infinitude
```

Or more convieniently, via the included [docker-compose file](https://github.com/nebulous/infinitude/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml).


#### Usage
 * Set your proxy server/port in the advanced wireless settings on the thermostat to point to your infinitude host/port. 
 * Edit the $conf section of the infinitude file to set your optional RS485 serial tty device.
 * Start Infinitude. This traffic is _not encrypted_, so only run on a trusted network.

Infinitude is a Mojolicious application, so the simplest way to run it is via:

    ./infinitude daemon

which starts a server in development mode on port 3000.

Or to listen on port 80:

    ./infinitude daemon -l http://:80

See ./infinitude <command> --help for additional options

With any luck, Carrier will allow the owners of these devices and data direct access rather
than this ridiculous work around. If you have one of these thermostats, tell
Carrier you'd like direct network access to your thermostat, or at the very
least, access to a public API!
